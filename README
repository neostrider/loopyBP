This implements sum product belief propagation for stereo depth estimation.

It expects as input three arguments: the left image, the right image (in that order) and maximum disparity in pixels. It is easy to figure out maximum disparity using a tool like gimp and viewing the images as layers.

It works better with higher resolution images. Try images from the middlebury dataset without downsampling.

The code is not yet optimized. Expect slow speed.
